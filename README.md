> [!INFO]
> You should allow all IPs, or all posible IPs, to connect to your MongoDB Atlas project when deploy, because deploying services often run various IPs. Go to your project in MongoDB Atlas **Network Access > Actions > EDIT > Allow access from anywhere**.

4. Have either Cloudflare Turnstile,
   [reCAPTCHA v3](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/) (upcoming...) or
   [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) (upcoming...) to secure your subscribe
   form.
5. Chose where to deploy your Webie application.

## Usage

### 1. Copy and configure the required environment variables

If you haven't creat a .env file:

Run this in `/` shell.

```sh
mv .env.sample .env
```

1. `DATABASE_URL`: We are using MongoDB, please replace your Username, Password,
   and name your Database Name.
2. (optional) `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`: This key is used to
   [get Turnstile token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/)
   in client, if you use
   [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/) as
   captcha, so should be exposed in the frontend with _VITE_\_ prefix.
3. (optional) `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`: Used to
   [verify Turnstile token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/server-side-validation/)
   get in the frontend in the backend
4. `AED_SECRET`: Used to encrypt your magic link for authentication flow. Run
   `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"` to
   get one.
5. `COOKIE_SECRET`: Used to make your cookies secure. Run
   `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"` to
   get one
6. `RESEND_API_KEY`: Send emails via Resend.
7. `BASE_URL`: This is the domain where you're hosting your Webie. e.g.
   `BASE_URL=webie.dev`
